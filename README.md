# Login functionality
The framework chosen to help us implement Authentication and Authorization was Asp.Net Identity. Asp.Net Idendity is a widely used Authentication and Authorization framework, that has very good documentation. Since a lot of our written study aids, and the content of the book 'Asp.Net Core in Action Third Edition' provides a very good presentation of the basic implementation of the Identity Framework, it was determined, that Identity could be incoorporated into our program within a reasonable time limit. It also provides all of the functionality, that our program needs, such as internal login and registration, and external OAuthentication using GitHub. It also neatly integrates into RazorPages, and provides ready-to-use classes such as SignInManager, UserManager, and User. Furthermore, User provides us with an easily extendable user class, that we can extend to fit our custom needs, such as a list of cheeps.
